# Overview <a name="overview"></a>
Receipt Hog is an online application that pays you money when you upload paper receipts. Now this money is real, it's not fake. I have tested and redeemed it myself via the PayPal application. I will show you the proof along with screenshots below. I have been using this application on my android phone for about 6 months now. There has been no glitch until now. Thanks to the software team, you are doing a great job. Being a software developer, I relate to this when someone gives positive feedback. Using this application is so easy, you don't need any prior experience to use this. You only need to upload your paper receipts as a photo and answer one or two simple questions. Simple I mean, it's a straightforward question guy. They just ask how many people went to the store and sometimes ask where did you make the purchase. The answers don't need to be correct. This is just their screening process.
