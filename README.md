# Overview <a name="overview"></a>
<p align = "justify">Receipt Hog is an online application that pays you money when you upload paper receipts. Now this money is real, it’s not fake. I have tested it myself and redeemed it via PayPal. I have been using this application on my Android phone for about 6 months now. There has been no glitch until now. Thanks to the software team, you are doing a great job. Being a software developer, I relate to this when someone gives positive feedback. This application is so easy that you don’t need any prior experience. You only need to upload your paper receipts as photos and answer one or two simple questions, such as how many people went to the store and the purchase location. Provide accurate answers. This is just their screening process.</p>

# How to Use the App <a name= "steps1"></a>
Turn your shopping into cash - <i>No matter what you shop or buy!</i>

# Download <a name= "download"></a>

1. Android - [Download](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.infoscout.receipthog&hl=en_CA&gl=US)
2. Apple - [Download](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/receipt-hog-shopping-rewards/id525373618)

# Progress Tracker <a name= "tracker"></a>

You can see your weekly receipt coin total on the progress bar. Now the best part about it is upon completion of the tracker, the additional receipts submitted during that week regardless of their total are worth 5 coins. Make sure you upload the highest dollar value receipts in the beginning so you can claim more coins don’t wait until the end, as you can see it’s only worth 5 coins. When the week resets, the progress bar also resets.

</p>


# Threshold Limits <a name= "threshold"></a>
## Upload Limits <a name="upload"></a>
You can upload up to 20 qualifying receipts; each receipt earns a reward, but additional receipts will not earn you any coins.

## Coin Threshold <a name= "coin"></a>
Upload up to 20 coin receipts each week; the application will disregard any excess receipts. The following shows the calculation of the weeks for the month.


| Week   | Days      | 
|----------|:-------------:|
| Week 1 | 1st - 7th |
| Week 2 | 8th - 14th |
| Week 3 | 15th - 21st |
| Week 4 | 22nd - End of the month |

> The weeks are calculated in Pacific Standard Time.

## Spin Threshold <a name= "spin"></a>
Similar to the Coin-Receipt threshold, the threshold for Spin-Receipts is also 20 Spin-receipts during each of the pre-defined weeks in the app


## Old Receipts <a name= "old"></a>
App receipt uploads are due within a fortnight (14 days) of the purchase date.

</p>

Once again, keep in mind the time zone that is being used is PST. The best solution here is to upload your receipts as you receive them rather than waiting til the last minute.


## Store Threshold <a name= "store"></a>

Regardless of the day they are uploaded and the location of the business, you can upload up to 3 receipts from the same store with the same transaction date.


<p align = "center">
  <img src = "https://github.com/Tanu-N-Prabhu/Receipt-Hog/blob/main/Img/Screenshot_20230321-083619.jpg" width="15%">
</p>

Uploading over 3 receipts triggers system processing; only the first 3 processed count towards the threshold. The system prioritizes shorter receipts over longer ones, potentially causing longer receipts to miss rewards. Because of the larger amount of information, longer receipts may require additional processing time.



# Earning Per Receipt <a name= "earnings"></a>

## Coins <a name= "coins2"></a>

You can earn coins from your receipts from any store, big or small, that sells groceries, health, or any products. You can then submit your paper receipts as an image. There is one catch here. Ensure you don’t upload the same receipts your friend who is already a member uploads just to avoid duplication.


| Receipt Total   |      Coins Earned      | 
|----------|:-------------:|
| Less than $10.00 | 5 Coins |
| $10.00 - $49.99 | 10 Coins |
| $50.00 - $99.99  | 15 Coins |
| $100.00+ | 20 Coins |

 ## Spins <a name= "spins2"></a>
 
You can earn 1 spin at the hog slots for every receipt from retailers like a clothing store, home improvement stores, sporting goods stores, and more. In Hog slots, you can have a chance to win more bonuses such as more coins, and other prizes, including having your last shopping trip paid for!

3. Hand-Written Receipts
4. Non-English/Foreign Receipts
5. Refund/Return of Purchase Slips

8. Non-Standard Receipts Not Printed From a Cash Register
9. Entertainment venue receipts or receipts from within such establishments

# Doctored Receipts <a name = "doctored"></a>

Altered receipts, screenshots from devices (tablets, PCs, etc.), and manipulated dates are deemed invalid. Submitting falsified receipts may result in account suspension, and any earned rewards may be forfeited if fraudulent activity is identified.

Receipt Hog relies on analyzing household spending patterns to provide rewards. To maintain the program’s integrity, only one account per household is permitted. Providing accurate information helps us sustain the reward system, ensuring users continue to benefit from submitting their receipts.

# Duplicate Receipts <a name = "duplicate"></a>

<p align = "center">
  <img src = "https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*JGZqiu7ODzS3hLQrLxqkAQ.jpeg" width="15%">
</p>

This means that the receipt already exists in their database. This usually means one of the following:

1. **Uploading a receipt more than once** — Re-uploading a receipt, whether it’s still processing or not, will flag it as a duplicate. Only re-upload if prompted after processing is complete.
2. **Hidden receipts** — Hiding receipts don’t delete them. Re-uploading a hidden receipt will flag it as a duplicate.
3. **Sharing receipts** — If another Receipt Hog user has already uploaded your receipt, it will be flagged as a duplicate.

# Weekly Submission Limit for Paper Receipts <a name = "weekly"></a>

Users can submit up to 60 paper receipts per week. The total is divided into the following categories:

1. 20 Coin-Receipts
2. 20 Spin-Receipts
3. 20 Sweepstakes-Receipts

Submitting over 20 receipts in any of these categories will trigger a threshold, and any additional receipts will not be accepted or rewarded.

# Conclusion <a name = "conclusion"></a>

In conclusion, Receipt Hog provides a unique and simple way to earn cash back by submitting your receipts. Whether you’re grocery shopping or making everyday purchases, this app offers an easy way to turn your receipts into rewards. By participating in surveys, spinning the prize wheel, and redeeming your coins for cash or gift cards, you can make the most of your everyday expenses.
