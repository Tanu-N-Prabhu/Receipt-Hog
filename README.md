# Introduction

Receipt Hog is a online application that pays you money when you upload paper receipts. Now this money is real, its not fake. I have tested and redeemed it myself via PayPal application. I will show you the proof along with screenshots below. I have been using this application on my android phone for the about 6 months now. There has been no glitch until now. Thanks to the software team, you are doing a great job. Being a software developer I can relate this when someone gives a positive feedback. Using this application is so easy, you don't need any proir experience to use this. All you need to do is upload your paper receipts as a photo and answer one or two simple questions. Simple I mean, its really simple question guys. They just ask how many people went to the store and where did you make this purchase. The answers don't need to be correct. This is just theire screening process.
