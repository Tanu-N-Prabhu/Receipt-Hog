# Overview <a name="overview"></a>
<p align = "justify">Receipt Hog is an online application that pays you money when you upload paper receipts. Now this money is real, it's not fake. I have tested and redeemed it myself via the PayPal application. I will show you the proof along with screenshots below. I have been using this application on my android phone for about 6 months now. There has been no glitch until now. Thanks to the software team, you are doing a great job. Being a software developer, I relate to this when someone gives positive feedback. Using this application is so easy, you don't need any prior experience to use this. You only need to upload your paper receipts as a photo and answer one or two simple questions. Simple I mean, it's a straightforward question guy. They just ask how many people went to the store and sometimes ask where did you make the purchase. The answers don't need to be correct. This is just their screening process. </p>

# Progress Tracker <a name= "tracker"></a>

There is a progress bar that shows the total number of coins that you have earned from the receipts in that current week. Now the best part about it is on completion of the tracker, the additional receipts submitted during that week regardless of their total are worth 5 coins. Make sure you upload the highest dollar value receipts in the beginning so you can claim more coins don’t wait until the end, as you can see it’s only worth 5 coins. When the week resets, the progress bar also resets.

# Threshold Limits <a name= "threshold"></a>
## Upload Limits <a name="upload"></a>
You can upload up to 20 qualifying receipts that can be rewarded per receipt, the rest on top of that will not get you aunty coins. 

## Coin Threshold <a name= "coin"></a>
You can upload up to 20 coin receipts during the week, anything past that would not be accounted for. The weeks for the month are calculated as shown below.

| Week   | Days      | 
|----------|:-------------:|
| Week 1 | 1st - 7th |
| Week 2 | 8th - 14th |
| Week 3 | 15th - 21st |
| Week 4 | 22nd - End of the month |

> The weeks are calculated in Pacific standard time.

## Spin Threshold <a name= "spin"></a>
Similar to the Coin-Receipt threshold, the threshold for Spin-Receipts is also 20 Spin-receipts during each of the pre-defined weeks in the app

## Old Receipts <a name= "old"></a>
A receipt must be uploaded to the app **no more than 14 days after the transaction date** as it appears on the receipt.

</p>

Once again keep in mind, the time zone that is being used is PST. The best solution here is to upload your receipts as you receive them rather than waiting til the last minute

## Store Threshold <a name= "store"></a>

Regardless of the day they are uploaded and the location of the business, you can upload up to 3 receipts from the same store with the same transaction date.  

<p align = "center">

</p>

Receipts contribute to this threshold as they are processed in our system so if you upload more than 3 receipts at once, the 3 receipts that finish processing first will qualify. Shorter receipts tend to process before longer receipts and may cause the long receipts to no longer qualify for rewards. Longer receipts naturally may take a bit longer to process since they have more information


# Earning Per Receipt <a name= "earnings"></a>

## Coins <a name= "coins2"></a>

You can earn coins from your receipts from any store, big or small that sells groceries, health, or any products. You can then submit your paper receipts as an image. There is one catch here. Make sure you don't upload the same receipts that your friend uploads who is already a member just to avoid duplication. 

| Receipt Total   |      Coins Earned      | 
|----------|:-------------:|
| Less than $10.00 | 5 Coins |
| $10.00 - $49.99 | 10 Coins |
| $50.00 - $99.99  | 15 Coins |
| $100.00+ | 20 Coins |
